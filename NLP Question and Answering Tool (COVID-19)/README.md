### Project Description
This is a question and answering tool for answering COVID-19 queries with the application of natural language processing techniques. All sentences from the selected scholar articles were implemented in a Word2Vec model for word embedding. 
A cosine similarity function was imported from the Word2Vec library to compare the sentence similarity between the selected body contexts from the scholar articles and the input question given by the users.

### Data
