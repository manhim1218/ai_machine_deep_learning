### Project Description
This is a question and answering tool for answering COVID-19 queries with the application of natural language processing techniques. All sentences from the selected scholar articles were implemented in a Word2Vec model for word embedding. 
A cosine similarity function was imported from the Word2Vec library to compare the sentence similarity between the selected body contexts from the scholar articles and the input question given by the users.

### Data
Dataset was publicly available on Kaggle and it contains more than 500,000 scholarly articles in the medical field. <br>

### Demo

Questions: Enter a question: What are signs and symptoms of the COVID-19?

Top Answer: 
The occurrence of hyposmia among Indian COVID-19 patients is 26.1% and that of hypogeusia is 26.8%. The proportion of
patients presenting with hyposmia as the first symptom is 7.67% and hypogeusia as first symptom is 3.13%. There was no
statistically significant difference between presence or absence of hyposmia/hypogeusia and severity of stage of COVID-19
disease. More than 96% of the patients fully recovered their sense of smell and taste sensation by the end of 5 weeks.
Increased public awareness measures regarding these symptoms and its prognosis are recommended, which can help in
early diagnosis, isolation and prevention of spread of pandemic. It should be highlighted to the patients and clinicians that
the hyposmia and hypogeusia are neither predictors nor protective of severity of COVID-19 disease.
